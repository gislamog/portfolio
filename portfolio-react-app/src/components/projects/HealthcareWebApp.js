                    We developed a healthcare consulting web app to streamline operations for a firm previously relying on Microsoft Word and email. Our solution, created as a senior year Software Engineering project by a team of four, simplifies the creation, management, and analysis of compliance data and facility management.
                </p>
                <p className="project-description">
                    The app features secure authentication and authorization, enabling employees to log field audit deficiencies and securely store images. Security was paramount due to sensitive healthcare data.

                <p className="project-description">
                    Our user-friendly solution empowered non-technical users to enhance their efficiency and organization. Additionally, we automated the compilation of individual reports into a comprehensive final report for administrative review and corrective action.

                    I worked in a team of four students and became the primary frontend designer and developer.
                    I set up the entire initial project infrastructure, including creating and organizing the Spring and React projects.
                    Additionally, I contributed to the database schema design and implemented authentication with Auth0, which was later replaced by Amazon Cognito.

                <p className="project-description">
                    I conducted security, speed, and compliance tests, ensuring we met our standards. I also played a key role in writing regular reports, such as retrospectives, meeting minutes, and plan reviews, and created UML diagrams to facilitate discussions and visualize project requirements.

                <p className="project-description">
                    I also developed the employee management functionality, allowing for the scheduling of employees and preventing double-booking. The system tracked vacations and absences, displaying employee availability when assigning tasks.

                    The project exceeded the firm's functional requirements, achieving 100% regulatory compliance and meeting target response times and performance levels.

                <p className="project-description">
                    Although we did not deploy the project to a server, our tests validated reliable photo upload functionality and enforced data access based on user roles.

                    Recommendations for future improvements include addressing security vulnerabilities, enhancing global accessibility, and regularly reviewing open-source dependencies. Continuous monitoring of performance and security is crucial for maintaining high standards and addressing challenges effectively.
